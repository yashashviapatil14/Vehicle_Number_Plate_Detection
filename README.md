# Vehicle_Number_Plate_Detection
This project automates the detection and recognition of vehicle license plates using OpenCV and EasyOCR. It processes an image to locate the license plate, extracts the text, and overlays it back onto the image.

Key Features:
✅ Preprocesses images with grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and edge detection

✅ Detects and isolates the license plate using contour approximation

✅ Extracts text using EasyOCR for accurate recognition

✅ Visualizes results by overlaying detected text on the original image

Technologies Used:

OpenCV – Image processing (edge detection, contour detection)

imutils – Simplifies contour handling

EasyOCR – Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Matplotlib – Visualization of intermediate and final results
