# Vehicle Number Plate Detection
## Project Overview
ðŸš— Ever wondered how automatic license plate recognition works?

This project explores the power of computer vision and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to detect and read vehicle number plates from images. Using OpenCV for image processing and EasyOCR for text extraction, this system can efficiently recognize license plates, enabling applications in traffic monitoring, toll collection, and automated parking systems.

By leveraging edge detection, contour approximation, and OCR, the system processes an image to locate the number plate, extract its text, and overlay it back onto the image. The result is an accurate and automated approach to license plate recognition, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.

Despite challenges like variable lighting conditions and noisy images, the project overcomes them with bilateral filtering, contour refinement, and preprocessing techniques to ensure robust performance.

Through projects like this, we're contributing to smart city solutions, where automation enhances security, efficiency, and intelligent transportation systems.
